Find numbers Divisible from 1 to 10 - Week 1 Challenge

For any given number N, find if the number is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Find all the possible numbers divisible and print them.

We can say number is divisible if the remainder is 0. For example number 81 is divisble by 1, 3, and 9

The solution can be addressed in many programming languages, we have used Python to find solve this.

How to run the program?

1. Open command prompt and navigate to the 

C:\workspace\Primepy>python divisible.py

2. The Program will execute and prompt user to enter a number, once the number is entered the results will be published as shown below

Enter the number you like to check: 56
The number 56 is divisible by following numbers from 1 till 10
[1, 2, 4, 7, 8]

3. To run the unit test case program run the below command

C:\workspace\Primepy>python -m unittest test_divisible.py

The output will be displayed as shown below
